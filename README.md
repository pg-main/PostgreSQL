# PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It offers advanced data management capabilities, excellent performance, and adherence to SQL standards, making it a top choice for enterprise solutions and developer applications. PostgreSQL is highly regarded for its extensibility, scalability, and reliability, featuring ACID compliance, JSON support, and high availability mechanisms.

- **Storage:** SSD for enhanced performance
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04+, Windows Server, macOS 13+

## Creating a Database
Once PostgreSQL is installed, you can create a new database using:
```sh
sudo -u postgres createdb mydatabase
```
Or via SQL command:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```
To list available databases:
```sql
\l
```

## Connecting to a Database
To establish a connection to a PostgreSQL database, use `psql`:
```sh
psql -U postgres -d mydatabase
```
Alternatively, within `psql`, switch between databases with:
```sql
\c mydatabase;
```

## Data Manipulation
### Inserting Data
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');
```
### Querying Data
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```
### Updating Data
```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```
### Deleting Data
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE name = 'John Doe';
```

## Indexing and Performance
Indexing enhances query execution speed. To create an index on a column:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```
To analyze query performance, use:
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='john@example.com';
```

## Security and Authentication
### Managing User Roles
Create a new database user:
```sql
CREATE ROLE dbuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'securepassword';
```
Assign database privileges:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO dbuser;
```
### Configuring Authentication
Modify `pg_hba.conf` to update authentication methods:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/16/main/pg_hba.conf
```

## Backup and Recovery
### Creating a Backup
```sh
pg_dump -U postgres -d mydatabase -f backup.sql
```
### Restoring a Backup
```sh
psql -U postgres -d mydatabase -f backup.sql
```

## Replication and High Availability
PostgreSQL supports replication to ensure high availability.
### Configuring Streaming Replication
1. Adjust `postgresql.conf` on the primary server:
```ini
wal_level = replica
max_wal_senders = 5
```
2. Define the replica server in `pg_hba.conf`:
```ini
host replication replicator 192.168.1.10/32 md5
```
3. Initiate the replication process:
```sh
pg_basebackup -h primary_host -D /var/lib/postgresql/16/main -U replicator -P -R
```
